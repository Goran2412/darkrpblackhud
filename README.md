[REUPLOAD + UPGRADE] DarkRP Black HUD

=======================================================================================

This addon/HUD is not mine. Couldn't find it anywhere so reuploaded it and upgraded it.
I don't know who this addon belongs to, but all credits to him or her.

========================================================================================

HUD upgrades/fixes:

Upgrades:

1) "+" on hud now used to let the player know if he is arrested. (red means arrested)
2) Now shows license next to the HUD

Fixes:

1) Armor bar not breaking out of its max range (used math.Clamp)

==========================================================================================

Any bug/glitch can be reported through my Steam (English or Spanish). Leave a comment before adding.
