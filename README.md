[REUPLOAD + UPGRADE] DarkRP Black HUD

=======================================================================================

This addon/HUD is not mine. Couldn't find it anywhere so reuploaded it and upgraded it.
I don't know who this addon belongs to, but all credits to him or her.

========================================================================================

HUD upgrades:

1) "+" on hud now used to let know the player if he is arrested. (red means arrested)
2) Armor bar not breaking out of its max range (used math.Clamp)
3) Now shows license next to the HUD

==========================================================================================

Any bug/glitch can be reported through my Steam (English or Spanish). Feel free to add me or just live a comment.
